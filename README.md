# growing with ai
A personal project aims to design interactive ai powreed learning experience for my kids
I started to pay attention to how my kids learn language, reading, writing and speaking.
And I try to create program which can help him to build a customized knowledge base so as to improve his learning process with more fun.

My ambition is to make a complete knowledge base and learning experience which copy the organic knowledge base of my kids in his brain.
The current version use my first kid to improve
So I can apply this to my second kid.
It'll take some time for me to organize all pieces of programs in one repo.


For example, writing:
We usually check writing by teacher, but ocr can do a better job.
Instead of just making ORC as a program, I want to make a mini competition, to let him try to write a word till OCR can recognize it properly, as the award to him.
This process suddently raised his interest.
